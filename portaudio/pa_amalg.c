 @brief Allocation Group prototypes. An Allocation Group makes it easy to
 allocate multiple blocks of memory and free them all at once.
 
 An allocation group is useful for keeping track of multiple blocks
 of memory which are allocated at the same time (such as during initialization)
 and need to be deallocated at the same time. The allocation group maintains
 a list of allocated blocks, and can free all allocations at once. This
 can be usefull for cleaning up after a partially initialized object fails.

 The allocation group implementation is built on top of the lower
 level allocation functions defined in pa_util.h

 @brief Configure endianness symbols for the target processor.

 Arrange for either the PA_LITTLE_ENDIAN or PA_BIG_ENDIAN preprocessor symbols
 to be defined. The one that is defined reflects the endianness of the target
 platform and may be used to implement conditional compilation of byte-order
 dependent code.

 If either PA_LITTLE_ENDIAN or PA_BIG_ENDIAN is defined already, then no attempt
 is made to override that setting. This may be useful if you have a better way
 of determining the platform's endianness. The autoconf mechanism uses this for
 example.

 A PA_VALIDATE_ENDIANNESS macro is provided to compare the compile time
 and runtime endiannes and raise an assertion if they don't match.

 @brief Buffer Processor prototypes. A Buffer Processor performs buffer length
 adaption, coordinates sample format conversion, and interleaves/deinterleaves
 channels.

 <h3>Overview</h3>

 The "Buffer Processor" (PaUtilBufferProcessor) manages conversion of audio
 data from host buffers to user buffers and back again. Where required, the
 buffer processor takes care of converting between host and user sample formats,
 interleaving and deinterleaving multichannel buffers, and adapting between host
 and user buffers with different lengths. The buffer processor may be used with
 full and half duplex streams, for both callback streams and blocking read/write
 streams.

 One of the important capabilities provided by the buffer processor is
 the ability to adapt between user and host buffer sizes of different lengths
 with minimum latency. Although this task is relatively easy to perform when
 the host buffer size is an integer multiple of the user buffer size, the
 problem is more complicated when this is not the case - especially for
 full-duplex callback streams. Where necessary the adaption is implemented by
 internally buffering some input and/or output data. The buffer adation
 algorithm used by the buffer processor was originally implemented by
 Stephan Letz for the ASIO version of PortAudio, and is described in his
 Callback_adaption_.pdf which is included in the distribution.

 The buffer processor performs sample conversion using the functions provided
 by pa_converters.c.

 The following sections provide an overview of how to use the buffer processor.
 Interested readers are advised to consult the host API implementations for
 examples of buffer processor usage.
 

 <h4>Initialization, resetting and termination</h4>

 When a stream is opened, the buffer processor should be initialized using
 PaUtil_InitializeBufferProcessor. This function initializes internal state
 and allocates temporary buffers as neccesary according to the supplied
 configuration parameters. Some of the parameters correspond to those requested
 by the user in their call to Pa_OpenStream(), others reflect the requirements
 of the host API implementation - they indicate host buffer sizes, formats,
 and the type of buffering which the Host API uses. The buffer processor should
 be initialized for callback streams and blocking read/write streams.

 Call PaUtil_ResetBufferProcessor to clear any sample data which is present
 in the buffer processor before starting to use it (for example when
 Pa_StartStream is called).

 When the buffer processor is no longer used call
 PaUtil_TerminateBufferProcessor.

 
 <h4>Using the buffer processor for a callback stream</h4>

 The buffer processor's role in a callback stream is to take host input buffers
 process them with the stream callback, and fill host output buffers. For a
 full duplex stream, the buffer processor handles input and output simultaneously
 due to the requirements of the minimum-latency buffer adation algorithm.

 When a host buffer becomes available, the implementation should call
 the buffer processor to process the buffer. The buffer processor calls the
 stream callback to consume and/or produce audio data as necessary. The buffer
 processor will convert sample formats, interleave/deinterleave channels,
 and slice or chunk the data to the appropriate buffer lengths according to
 the requirements of the stream callback and the host API.

 To process a host buffer (or a pair of host buffers for a full-duplex stream)
 use the following calling sequence:

 -# Call PaUtil_BeginBufferProcessing
 -# For a stream which takes input:
    - Call PaUtil_SetInputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host input
        buffer.
    - Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host input buffer(s): PaUtil_SetInputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedInputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedInputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
    - If the available host data is split accross two buffers (for example a
        data range at the end of a circular buffer and another range at the
        beginning of the circular buffer), also call
        PaUtil_Set2ndInputFrameCount, PaUtil_Set2ndInputChannel,
        PaUtil_Set2ndInterleavedInputChannels,
        PaUtil_Set2ndNonInterleavedInputChannel as necessary to tell the buffer
        processor about the second buffer.
 -# For a stream which generates output:
    - Call PaUtil_SetOutputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        output buffer.
    - Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host output buffer(s): PaUtil_SetOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedOutputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedOutputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
    - If the available host output buffer space is split accross two buffers
        (for example a data range at the end of a circular buffer and another
        range at the beginning of the circular buffer), call
        PaUtil_Set2ndOutputFrameCount, PaUtil_Set2ndOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_Set2ndInterleavedOutputChannels,
        PaUtil_Set2ndNonInterleavedOutputChannel as necessary to tell the buffer
        processor about the second buffer.
 -# Call PaUtil_EndBufferProcessing, this function performs the actual data
    conversion and processing.


 <h4>Using the buffer processor for a blocking read/write stream</h4>

 Blocking read/write streams use the buffer processor to convert and copy user
 output data to a host buffer, and to convert and copy host input data to
 the user's buffer. The buffer processor does not perform any buffer adaption.
 When using the buffer processor in a blocking read/write stream the input and
 output conversion are performed separately by the PaUtil_CopyInput and
 PaUtil_CopyOutput functions.

 To copy data from a host input buffer to the buffer(s) which the user supplies
 to Pa_ReadStream, use the following calling sequence.

 - Repeat the following three steps until the user buffer(s) have been filled
    with samples from the host input buffers:
     -# Call PaUtil_SetInputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        input buffer.
     -# Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host input buffer(s): PaUtil_SetInputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedInputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedInputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
     -# Call PaUtil_CopyInput with the user buffer pointer (or a copy of the
        array of buffer pointers for a non-interleaved stream) passed to
        Pa_ReadStream, along with the number of frames in the user buffer(s).
        Be careful to pass a <i>copy</i> of the user buffer pointers to
        PaUtil_CopyInput because PaUtil_CopyInput advances the pointers to
        the start of the next region to copy.
 - PaUtil_CopyInput will not copy more data than is available in the
    host buffer(s), so the above steps need to be repeated until the user
    buffer(s) are full.

 
 To copy data to the host output buffer from the user buffers(s) supplied
 to Pa_WriteStream use the following calling sequence.

 - Repeat the following three steps until all frames from the user buffer(s)
    have been copied to the host API:
     -# Call PaUtil_SetOutputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        output buffer.
     -# Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host output buffer(s): PaUtil_SetOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedOutputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedOutputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
     -# Call PaUtil_CopyOutput with the user buffer pointer (or a copy of the
        array of buffer pointers for a non-interleaved stream) passed to
        Pa_WriteStream, along with the number of frames in the user buffer(s).
        Be careful to pass a <i>copy</i> of the user buffer pointers to 
        PaUtil_CopyOutput because PaUtil_CopyOutput advances the pointers to
        the start of the next region to copy.
 - PaUtil_CopyOutput will not copy more data than fits in the host buffer(s),
    so the above steps need to be repeated until all user data is copied.

 @brief Single-reader single-writer lock-free ring buffer

 PaUtilRingBuffer is a ring buffer used to transport samples between
 different execution contexts (threads, OS callbacks, interrupt handlers)
 without requiring the use of any locks. This only works when there is
 a single reader and a single writer (ie. one thread or callback writes
 to the ring buffer, another thread or callback reads from it).

 The PaUtilRingBuffer structure manages a ring buffer containing N 
 elements, where N must be a power of two. An element may be any size 
 (specified in bytes).

 The memory area used to store the buffer elements must be allocated by 
 the client prior to calling PaUtil_InitializeRingBuffer() and must outlive
 the use of the ring buffer.
 
 @note The ring buffer functions are not normally exposed in the PortAudio libraries. 
 If you want to call them then you will need to add pa_ringbuffer.c to your application source code.

The following alternate dither algorithms (from musicdsp.org) could be

/*Noise shaped dither  (March 2000)
-------------------

This is a simple implementation of highpass triangular-PDF dither with
2nd-order noise shaping, for use when truncating floating point audio
data to fixed point.

The noise shaping lowers the noise floor by 11dB below 5kHz (@ 44100Hz
sample rate) compared to triangular-PDF dither. The code below assumes
input data is in the range +1 to -1 and doesn't check for overloads!

To save time when generating dither for multiple channels you can do
things like this:  r3=(r1 & 0x7F)<<8; instead of calling rand() again.



  int   r1, r2;                //rectangular-PDF random numbers
  float s1, s2;                //error feedback buffers
  float s = 0.5f;              //set to 0.0f for no noise shaping
  float w = pow(2.0,bits-1);   //word length (usually bits=16)
  float wi= 1.0f/w;            
  float d = wi / RAND_MAX;     //dither amplitude (2 lsb)
  float o = wi * 0.5f;         //remove dc offset
  float in, tmp;
  int   out;


//for each sample...

  r2=r1;                               //can make HP-TRI dither by
  r1=rand();                           //subtracting previous rand()
    
  in += s * (s1 + s1 - s2);            //error feedback
  tmp = in + o + d * (float)(r1 - r2); //dc offset and dither 
  
  out = (int)(w * tmp);                //truncate downwards
  if(tmp<0.0f) out--;                  //this is faster than floor()

  s2 = s1;                            
  s1 = in - wi * (float)out;           //error

16-to-8-bit first-order dither

Type : First order error feedforward dithering code
References : Posted by Jon Watte

Notes : 
This is about as simple a dithering algorithm as you can implement, but it's
likely to sound better than just truncating to N bits.

Note that you might not want to carry forward the full difference for infinity.
It's probably likely that the worst performance hit comes from the saturation
conditionals, which can be avoided with appropriate instructions on many DSPs
and integer SIMD type instructions, or CMOV.

Last, if sound quality is paramount (such as when going from > 16 bits to 16
bits) you probably want to use a higher-order dither function found elsewhere
on this site. 


Code : 
// This code will down-convert and dither a 16-bit signed short 
// mono signal into an 8-bit unsigned char signal, using a first 
// order forward-feeding error term dither. 

#define uchar unsigned char 

void dither_one_channel_16_to_8( short * input, uchar * output, int count, int * memory ) 
{ 
  int m = *memory; 
  while( count-- > 0 ) { 
    int i = *input++; 
    i += m; 
    int j = i + 32768 - 128; 
    uchar o; 
    if( j < 0 ) { 
      o = 0; 
    } 
    else if( j > 65535 ) { 
      o = 255; 
    } 
    else { 
      o = (uchar)((j>>8)&0xff); 
    } 
    m = ((j-32768+128)-i); 
    *output++ = o;

 @brief Implements PortAudio API functions defined in portaudio.h, checks
 some errors, delegates platform-specific behavior to host API implementations.

 Implements the functions defined in the PortAudio API (portaudio.h),
 validates some parameters and checks for state inconsistencies before
 forwarding API requests to specific Host API implementations (via the
 interface declared in pa_hostapi.h), and Streams (via the interface
 declared in pa_stream.h).

 This file manages initialization and termination of Host API
 implementations via initializer functions stored in the paHostApiInitializers
 global array (usually defined in an os-specific pa_[os]_hostapis.c file).

 This file maintains a list of all open streams and closes them at Pa_Terminate().

 Some utility functions declared in pa_util.h are implemented in this file.

 All PortAudio API functions can be conditionally compiled with logging code.
 To compile with logging, define the PA_LOG_API_CALLS precompiler symbol.

    NOTE: make sure this validation list is kept syncronised with the one in
            pa_hostapi.h

    ValidateOpenStreamParameters() checks that parameters to Pa_OpenStream()
    conform to the expected values as described below. This function is
    also designed to be used with the proposed Pa_IsFormatSupported() function.

    There are basically two types of validation that could be performed:
    Generic conformance validation, and device capability mismatch
    validation. This function performs only generic conformance validation.
    Validation that would require knowledge of device capabilities is
    not performed because of potentially complex relationships between
    combinations of parameters - for example, even if the sampleRate
    seems ok, it might not be for a duplex stream - we have no way of
    checking this in an API-neutral way, so we don't try.

    On success the function returns PaNoError and fills in hostApi,
    hostApiInputDeviceID, and hostApiOutputDeviceID fields. On failure
    the function returns an error code indicating the first encountered
    parameter error.


    If ValidateOpenStreamParameters() returns paNoError, the following
    assertions are guaranteed to be true.

    - at least one of inputParameters & outputParmeters is valid (not NULL)

    - if inputParameters & outputParameters are both valid, that
        inputParameters->device & outputParameters->device  both use the same host api

    PaDeviceIndex inputParameters->device
        - is within range (0 to Pa_GetDeviceCount-1) Or:
        - is paUseHostApiSpecificDeviceSpecification and
            inputParameters->hostApiSpecificStreamInfo is non-NULL and refers
            to a valid host api

    int inputParameters->channelCount
        - if inputParameters->device is not paUseHostApiSpecificDeviceSpecification, channelCount is > 0
        - upper bound is NOT validated against device capabilities

    PaSampleFormat inputParameters->sampleFormat
        - is one of the sample formats defined in portaudio.h

    void *inputParameters->hostApiSpecificStreamInfo
        - if supplied its hostApi field matches the input device's host Api

    PaDeviceIndex outputParmeters->device
        - is within range (0 to Pa_GetDeviceCount-1)

    int outputParmeters->channelCount
        - if inputDevice is valid, channelCount is > 0
        - upper bound is NOT validated against device capabilities

    PaSampleFormat outputParmeters->sampleFormat
        - is one of the sample formats defined in portaudio.h

    void *outputParmeters->hostApiSpecificStreamInfo
        - if supplied its hostApi field matches the output device's host Api

    double sampleRate
        - is not an 'absurd' rate (less than 1000. or greater than 384000.)
        - sampleRate is NOT validated against device capabilities

    PaStreamFlags streamFlags
        - unused platform neutral flags are zero
        - paNeverDropInput is only used for full-duplex callback streams with
            variable buffer size (paFramesPerBufferUnspecified)

    the main reason these versions are faster than the equivalent C versions
    is that float -> int casting is expensive in C on x86 because the rounding
    mode needs to be changed for every cast. these versions only set
    the rounding mode once outside the loop.

    small additional speed gains are made by the way that clamping is
    implemented.

TODO:
    o- inline dither code
    o- implement Dither only (no-clip) versions
    o- implement int8 and uint8 versions
    o- test thouroughly

    the following notes were used to determine whether a floating point
    value should be saturated (ie >1 or <-1) by loading it into an integer
    register. these should be rewritten so that they make sense.

    an ieee floating point value

    1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?


    is less than  or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to -1 either:

        if the mantissa is 0 and the unbiased exponent is 0

        OR

        if the unbiased exponent < 0

    this translates to:

        if the mantissa is 0 and the biased exponent is 7F

        or

        if the biased exponent is less than 7F


    therefore the value is greater than 1 or less than -1 if

        the mantissa is not 0 and the biased exponent is 7F

        or

        if the biased exponent is greater than 7F


    in other words, if we mask out the sign bit, the value is
    greater than 1 or less than -1 if its integer representation is greater than:

    0 01111111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000

/* We need to determine how many frames per host buffer (period) to use.  Our

 *   - the period sizes that playback and/or capture support.  The

 *   - the number of periods that playback and/or capture support.
 *
 * We want to make period_size*(num_periods-1) to be as close as possible

 *
 * This method will determine suitable period sizes for capture and playback handles, and report the maximum number of

 * between capture and playback. If this should happen, the stream's hostBufferSizeMode attribute will be set to
 * paUtilBoundedHostBufferSize, because the best we can do is limit the size of individual host buffers to the upper
 * bound. The size of host buffers scheduled for processing should only matter if the user has specified a buffer size,
 * but when he/she does we must strive for an optimal configuration. By default we'll opt for a fixed host buffer size,
 * which should be fine if the period size is the same for capture and playback. In general, if there is a specified user
 * buffer size, this method tries it best to determine a period size which is a multiple of the user buffer size.
 *
 * The framesPerPeriod attributes of the individual capture and playback components of the stream are set to corresponding
 * values determined here. Since these should be reported as

 @brief Host API implementation supporting AudioScience cards
        via the Linux HPI interface.

 <h3>Overview</h3>

 This is a PortAudio implementation for the AudioScience HPI Audio API
 on the Linux platform. AudioScience makes a range of audio adapters customised
 for the broadcasting industry, with support for both Windows and Linux.
 More information on their products can be found on their website:

     http://www.audioscience.com

 Documentation for the HPI API can be found at:

     http://www.audioscience.com/internet/download/sdk/hpi_usermanual_html/html/index.html

 The Linux HPI driver itself (a kernel module + library) can be downloaded from:

     http://www.audioscience.com/internet/download/linux_drivers.htm

 <h3>Implementation strategy</h3>

 *Note* Ideally, AudioScience cards should be handled by the PortAudio ALSA
 implementation on Linux, as ALSA is the preferred Linux soundcard API. The existence
 of this host API implementation might therefore seem a bit flawed. Unfortunately, at
 the time of the creation of this implementation (June 2006), the PA ALSA implementation
 could not make use of the existing AudioScience ALSA driver. PA ALSA uses the
 "memory-mapped" (mmap) ALSA access mode to interact with the ALSA library, while the
 AudioScience ALSA driver only supports the "read-write" access mode. The appropriate
 solution to this problem is to add "read-write" support to PortAudio ALSA, thereby
 extending the range of soundcards it supports (AudioScience cards are not the only
 ones with this problem). Given the author's limited knowledge of ALSA and the
 simplicity of the HPI API, the second-best solution was born...

 The following mapping between HPI and PA was followed:
 HPI subsystem => PortAudio host API
 HPI adapter => nothing specific
 HPI stream => PortAudio device

 Each HPI stream is either input or output (not both), and can support
 different channel counts, sampling rates and sample formats. It is therefore
 a more natural fit to a PA device. A PA stream can therefore combine two
 HPI streams (one input and one output) into a "full-duplex" stream. These
 HPI streams can even be on different physical adapters. The two streams ought to be
 sample-synchronised when they reside on the same adapter, as most AudioScience adapters
 derive their ADC and DAC clocks from one master clock. When combining two adapters
 into one full-duplex stream, however, the use of a word clock connection between the
 adapters is strongly recommended.

 The HPI interface is inherently blocking, making use of read and write calls to
 transfer data between user buffers and driver buffers. The callback interface therefore
 requires a helper thread ("callback engine") which periodically transfers data (one thread
 per PA stream, in fact). The current implementation explicitly sleeps via Pa_Sleep() until
 enough samples can be transferred (select() or poll() would be better, but currently seems
 impossible...). The thread implementation makes use of the Unix thread helper functions
 and some pthread calls here and there. If a unified PA thread exists, this host API
 implementation might also compile on Windows, as this is the only real Linux-specific
 part of the code.

 There is no inherent fixed buffer size in the HPI interface, as in some other host APIs.
 The PortAudio implementation contains a buffer that is allocated during OpenStream and
 used to transfer data between the callback and the HPI driver buffer. The size of this
 buffer is quite flexible and is derived from latency suggestions and matched to the
 requested callback buffer size as far as possible. It can become quite huge, as the
 AudioScience cards are typically geared towards higher-latency applications and contain
 large hardware buffers.

 The HPI interface natively supports most common sample formats and sample rates (some
 conversion is done on the adapter itself).

 Stream time is measured based on the number of processed frames, which is adjusted by the
 number of frames currently buffered by the HPI driver.

 There is basic support for detecting overflow and underflow. The HPI interface does not
 explicitly indicate this, so thresholds on buffer levels are used in combination with
 stream state. Recovery from overflow and underflow is left to the PA client.

 Blocking streams are also implemented. It makes use of the same polling routines that
 the callback interface uses, in order to prevent the allocation of variable-sized
 buffers during reading and writing. The framesPerBuffer parameter is therefore still
 relevant, and this can be increased in the blocking case to improve efficiency.

 The implementation contains extensive reporting macros (slightly modified PA_ENSURE and
 PA_UNLESS versions) and a useful stream dump routine to provide debugging feedback.

 Output buffer priming via the user callback (i.e. paPrimeOutputBuffersUsingStreamCallback
 and friends) is not implemented yet. All output is primed with silence.

/** Stream state as defined by PortAudio.
 It seems that the host API implementation has to keep track of the PortAudio stream state.
 Please note that this is NOT the same as the state of the underlying HPI stream. By separating
 these two concepts, a lot of flexibility is gained. There is a rough match between the two,
 of course, but forcing a precise match is difficult. For example, HPI_STATE_DRAINED can occur
 during the Active state of PortAudio (due to underruns) and also during CallBackFinished in
 the case of an output stream. Similarly, HPI_STATE_STOPPED mostly coincides with the Stopped
 PortAudio state, by may also occur in the CallbackFinished state when recording is finished.

 Here is a rough match-up:

 PortAudio state   =>     HPI state
 ---------------          ---------
 Active            =>     HPI_STATE_RECORDING, HPI_STATE_PLAYING, (HPI_STATE_DRAINED)

/** Determine buffer sizes and allocate appropriate stream buffers.
 This attempts to allocate a BBM (host) buffer for the HPI stream component (either input
 or output, as both have similar buffer needs). Not all AudioScience adapters support BBM,
 in which case the hardware buffer has to suffice. The size of the HPI host buffer is chosen
 as a multiple of framesPerPaHostBuffer, and also influenced by the suggested latency and the
 estimated minimum polling interval. The HPI host and hardware buffer sizes are stored, and an
 appropriate cap for the hardware buffer is also calculated. Finally, the temporary stream
 buffer which serves as the PortAudio host buffer for this implementation is allocated.
 This buffer contains an integer number of user buffers, to simplify buffer adaption in the
 buffer processor. The function returns paBufferTooBig if the HPI interface cannot allocate
 an HPI host buffer of the desired size.

// File:			IASIOThiscallResolver.h
// Description:     The IASIOThiscallResolver class implements the IASIO
//					interface and acts as a proxy to the real IASIO interface by
//                  calling through its vptr table using the thiscall calling
//                  convention. To put it another way, we interpose
//                  IASIOThiscallResolver between ASIO SDK code and the driver.
//                  This is necessary because most non-Microsoft compilers don't
//                  implement the thiscall calling convention used by IASIO.
//
//					iasiothiscallresolver.cpp contains the background of this
//					problem plus a technical description of the vptr
//                  manipulations.
//
//					In order to use this mechanism one simply has to add
//					iasiothiscallresolver.cpp to the list of files to compile
//                  and #include <iasiothiscallresolver.h>
//
//					Note that this #include must come after the other ASIO SDK
//                  #includes, for example:
//
//					#include <windows.h>
//					#include <asiosys.h>
//					#include <asio.h>
//					#include <asiodrivers.h>
//					#include <iasiothiscallresolver.h>
//
//					Actually the important thing is to #include
//                  <iasiothiscallresolver.h> after <asio.h>. We have
//                  incorporated a test to enforce this ordering.
//
//					The code transparently takes care of the interposition by
//                  using macro substitution to intercept calls to ASIOInit()
//                  and ASIOExit(). We save the original ASIO global
//                  "theAsioDriver" in our "that" variable, and then set
//                  "theAsioDriver" to equal our IASIOThiscallResolver instance.
//
// 					Whilst this method of resolving the thiscall problem requires
//					the addition of #include <iasiothiscallresolver.h> to client
//                  code it has the advantage that it does not break the terms
//                  of the ASIO licence by publishing it. We are NOT modifying
//                  any Steinberg code here, we are merely implementing the IASIO
//					interface in the same way that we would need to do if we
//					wished to provide an open source ASIO driver.
//
//					For compilation with MinGW -lole32 needs to be added to the
//                  linker options. For BORLAND, linking with Import32.lib is
//                  sufficient.
//
//					The dependencies are with: CoInitialize, CoUninitialize,
//					CoCreateInstance, CLSIDFromString - used by asiolist.cpp
//					and are required on Windows whether ThiscallResolver is used
//					or not.
//
//					Searching for the above strings in the root library path
//					of your compiler should enable the correct libraries to be
//					identified if they aren't immediately obvious.
//
//                  Note that the current implementation of IASIOThiscallResolver
//                  is not COM compliant - it does not correctly implement the
//                  IUnknown interface. Implementing it is not necessary because
//                  it is not called by parts of the ASIO SDK which call through
//                  theAsioDriver ptr. The IUnknown methods are implemented as
//                  assert(false) to ensure that the code fails if they are
//                  ever called.
// Restrictions:	None. Public Domain & Open Source distribute freely
//					You may use IASIOThiscallResolver commercially as well as
//                  privately.
//					You the user assume the responsibility for the use of the
//					files, binary or text, and there is no guarantee or warranty,
//					expressed or implied, including but not limited to the

//					to hold no entity, copyright holder or distributors liable
//					for any loss of data or inaccurate representations of data
//					as a result of using IASIOThiscallResolver.
// Version:         1.4 Added separate macro CALL_THISCALL_1_DOUBLE from
//                  Andrew Baldwin, and volatile for whole gcc asm blocks,
//                  both for compatibility with newer gcc versions. Cleaned up
//                  Borland asm to use one less register.
//                  1.3 Switched to including assert.h for better compatibility.
//                  Wrapped entire .h and .cpp contents with a check for
//                  _MSC_VER to provide better compatibility with MS compilers.
//                  Changed Singleton implementation to use static instance
//                  instead of freestore allocated instance. Removed ASIOExit
//                  macro as it is no longer needed.
//                  1.2 Removed semicolons from ASIOInit and ASIOExit macros to
//                  allow them to be embedded in expressions (if statements).
//                  Cleaned up some comments. Removed combase.c dependency (it
//                  doesn't compile with BCB anyway) by stubbing IUnknown.
//                  1.1 Incorporated comments from Ross Bencina including things
//					such as changing name from ThiscallResolver to
//					IASIOThiscallResolver, tidying up the constructor, fixing
//					a bug in IASIOThiscallResolver::ASIOExit() and improving
//					portability through the use of conditional compilation
//					1.0 Initial working version.

    BACKGROUND

    The IASIO interface declared in the Steinberg ASIO 2 SDK declares
    functions with no explicit calling convention. This causes MSVC++ to default
    to using the thiscall convention, which is a proprietary convention not
    implemented by some non-microsoft compilers - notably borland BCC,
    C++Builder, and gcc. MSVC++ is the defacto standard compiler used by
    Steinberg. As a result of this situation, the ASIO sdk will compile with
    any compiler, however attempting to execute the compiled code will cause a
    crash due to different default calling conventions on non-Microsoft
    compilers.

    IASIOThiscallResolver solves the problem by providing an adapter class that
    delegates to the IASIO interface using the correct calling convention
    (thiscall). Due to the lack of support for thiscall in the Borland and GCC
    compilers, the calls have been implemented in assembly language.

    A number of macros are defined for thiscall function calls with different
    numbers of parameters, with and without return values - it may be possible
    to modify the format of these macros to make them work with other inline
    assemblers.


    THISCALL DEFINITION

    A number of definitions of the thiscall calling convention are floating
    around the internet. The following definition has been validated against
    output from the MSVC++ compiler:

    For non-vararg functions, thiscall works as follows: the object (this)
    pointer is passed in ECX. All arguments are passed on the stack in
    right to left order. The return value is placed in EAX. The callee
    clears the passed arguments from the stack.


    FINDING FUNCTION POINTERS FROM AN IASIO POINTER

    The first field of a COM object is a pointer to its vtble. Thus a pointer
    to an object implementing the IASIO interface also points to a pointer to
    that object's vtbl. The vtble is a table of function pointers for all of
    the virtual functions exposed by the implemented interfaces.

    If we consider a variable declared as a pointer to IASO:

    IASIO *theAsioDriver

    theAsioDriver points to:

    object implementing IASIO
    {
        IASIOvtbl *vtbl
        other data
    }

    in other words, theAsioDriver points to a pointer to an IASIOvtbl

    vtbl points to a table of function pointers:

    IASIOvtbl ( interface IASIO : public IUnknown )
    {
    (IUnknown functions)
    0   virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE (*QueryInterface)(REFIID riid, void **ppv) = 0;
    4   virtual ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE (*AddRef)() = 0;
    8   virtual ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE (*Release)() = 0;      

    (IASIO functions)
    12	virtual ASIOBool (*init)(void *sysHandle) = 0;
    16	virtual void (*getDriverName)(char *name) = 0;
    20	virtual long (*getDriverVersion)() = 0;
    24	virtual void (*getErrorMessage)(char *string) = 0;
    28	virtual ASIOError (*start)() = 0;
    32	virtual ASIOError (*stop)() = 0;
    36	virtual ASIOError (*getChannels)(long *numInputChannels, long *numOutputChannels) = 0;
    40	virtual ASIOError (*getLatencies)(long *inputLatency, long *outputLatency) = 0;
    44	virtual ASIOError (*getBufferSize)(long *minSize, long *maxSize,
            long *preferredSize, long *granularity) = 0;
    48	virtual ASIOError (*canSampleRate)(ASIOSampleRate sampleRate) = 0;
    52	virtual ASIOError (*getSampleRate)(ASIOSampleRate *sampleRate) = 0;
    56	virtual ASIOError (*setSampleRate)(ASIOSampleRate sampleRate) = 0;
    60	virtual ASIOError (*getClockSources)(ASIOClockSource *clocks, long *numSources) = 0;
    64	virtual ASIOError (*setClockSource)(long reference) = 0;
    68	virtual ASIOError (*getSamplePosition)(ASIOSamples *sPos, ASIOTimeStamp *tStamp) = 0;
    72	virtual ASIOError (*getChannelInfo)(ASIOChannelInfo *info) = 0;
    76	virtual ASIOError (*createBuffers)(ASIOBufferInfo *bufferInfos, long numChannels,
            long bufferSize, ASIOCallbacks *callbacks) = 0;
    80	virtual ASIOError (*disposeBuffers)() = 0;
    84	virtual ASIOError (*controlPanel)() = 0;
    88	virtual ASIOError (*future)(long selector,void *opt) = 0;
    92	virtual ASIOError (*outputReady)() = 0;
    };

    The numbers in the left column show the byte offset of each function ptr
    from the beginning of the vtbl. These numbers are used in the code below
    to select different functions.

    In order to find the address of a particular function, theAsioDriver
    must first be dereferenced to find the value of the vtbl pointer:

    mov     eax, theAsioDriver
    mov     edx, [theAsioDriver]  // edx now points to vtbl[0]

    Then an offset must be added to the vtbl pointer to select a
    particular function, for example vtbl+44 points to the slot containing
    a pointer to the getBufferSize function.

    Finally vtbl+x must be dereferenced to obtain the value of the function
    pointer stored in that address:

    call    [edx+44]    // call the function pointed to by
                        // the value in the getBufferSize field of the vtbl


    SEE ALSO

    Martin Fay's OpenASIO DLL at http://www.martinfay.com solves the same
    problem by providing a new COM interface which wraps IASIO with an
    interface that uses portable calling conventions. OpenASIO must be compiled
    with MSVC, and requires that you ship the OpenASIO DLL with your
    application.

    
    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Ross Bencina: worked out the thiscall details above, wrote the original
    Borland asm macros, and a patch for asio.cpp (which is no longer needed).
    Thanks to Martin Fay for introducing me to the issues discussed here,
    and to Rene G. Ceballos for assisting with asm dumps from MSVC++.

    Antti Silvast: converted the original calliasio to work with gcc and NASM
    by implementing the asm code in a separate file.

	Fraser Adams: modified the original calliasio containing the Borland inline
    asm to add inline asm for gcc i.e. Intel syntax for Borland and AT&T syntax
    for gcc. This seems a neater approach for gcc than to have a separate .asm
    file and it means that we only need one version of the thiscall patch.

    Fraser Adams: rewrote the original calliasio patch in the form of the
    IASIOThiscallResolver class in order to avoid modifications to files from
    the Steinberg SDK, which may have had potential licence issues.

    Andrew Baldwin: contributed fixes for compatibility problems with more
    recent versions of the gcc assembler.

/*
    FindDevicePnpInterfaces fills in the pnpInterface fields in deviceNamesAndGUIDs
    with UNICODE file paths to the devices. The DS documentation mentions
    at least two techniques by which these Interface paths can be found using IKsPropertySet on
    the DirectSound class object. One is using the DSPROPERTY_DIRECTSOUNDDEVICE_DESCRIPTION 
    property, and the other is using DSPROPERTY_DIRECTSOUNDDEVICE_ENUMERATE.
    I tried both methods and only the second worked. I found two postings on the
    net from people who had the same problem with the first method, so I think the method used here is 
    more common/likely to work. The probem is that IKsPropertySet_Get returns S_OK
    but the fields of the device description are not filled in.

    The mechanism we use works by registering an enumeration callback which is called for 
    every DSound device. Our callback searches for a device in our deviceNamesAndGUIDs list
    with the matching GUID and copies the pointer to the Interface path.
    Note that we could have used this enumeration callback to perform the original 
    device enumeration, however we choose not to so we can disable this step easily.

    Apparently the IKsPropertySet mechanism was added in DirectSound 9c 2004
    http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/Development/microsoft.public.win32.programmer.mmedia/2004-12/0099.html

@brief Portaudio WDM-KS host API.

@note This is the implementation of the Portaudio host API using the
Windows WDM/Kernel Streaming API in order to enable very low latency
playback and recording on all modern Windows platforms (e.g. 2K, XP, Vista, Win7)
Note: This API accesses the device drivers below the usual KMIXER
component which is normally used to enable multi-client mixing and
format conversion. That means that it will lock out all other users
of a device for the duration of active stream using those devices

/* Modification History:
 PLB = Phil Burk
 JM = Julien Maillard
 RDB = Ross Bencina
 PLB20010402 - sDevicePtrs now allocates based on sizeof(pointer)
 PLB20010413 - check for excessive numbers of channels
 PLB20010422 - apply Mike Berry's changes for CodeWarrior on PC
               including conditional inclusion of memory.h,
               and explicit typecasting on memory allocation
 PLB20010802 - use GlobalAlloc for sDevicesPtr instead of PaHost_AllocFastMemory
 PLB20010816 - pass process instead of thread to SetPriorityClass()
 PLB20010927 - use number of frames instead of real-time for CPULoad calculation.
 JM20020118 - prevent hung thread when buffers underflow.
 PLB20020321 - detect Win XP versus NT, 9x; fix DBUG typo; removed init of CurrentCount
 RDB20020411 - various renaming cleanups, factored streamData alloc and cpu usage init
 RDB20020417 - stopped counting WAVE_MAPPER when there were no real devices
               refactoring, renaming and fixed a few edge case bugs
 RDB20020531 - converted to V19 framework

/*
    How it works:

    For both callback and blocking read/write streams we open the MME devices
    in CALLBACK_EVENT mode. In this mode, MME signals an Event object whenever
    it has finished with a buffer (either filled it for input, or played it
    for output). Where necessary, we block waiting for Event objects using
    WaitMultipleObjects().

    When implementing a PA callback stream, we set up a high priority thread
    which waits on the MME buffer Events and drains/fills the buffers when
    they are ready.

    When implementing a PA blocking read/write stream, we simply wait on these
    Events (when necessary) inside the ReadStream() and WriteStream() functions.
